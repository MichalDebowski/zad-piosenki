    <h2>Don't Stay</h2>
    <p>
Sometimes I need to remember just to breathe<br/>
Sometimes I need you to stay away from me<br/>
Sometimes I'm in disbelief I didn't know<br/>
Somehow I need you to go  
    </p>
    <p>
Don’t stay<br/>
Forget our memories<br/>
Forget our possibilities<br/>
What you were changing me into<br/>
(Just give me myself back and)<br/>
Don’t stay<br/>
Forget our memories<br/>
Forget our possibilities<br/>
Take all your faithlessness with you<br/>
(Just give me myself back and)<br/>
Don’t stay 
    </p>
    <p>
Sometimes I feel like I trusted you too well<br/>
Sometimes I just feel like screaming at myself<br/>
Sometimes I'm in disbelief I didn't know<br/>
Somehow I need to be alone 
</p>
<p>
Don’t stay<br/>
Forget our memories<br/>
Forget our possibilities<br/>
What you were changing me into<br/>
(Just give me myself back and)<br/>
Don’t stay<br/>
Forget our memories<br/>
Forget our possibilities<br/>
Take all your faithlessness with you<br/>
(Just give me myself back and)<br/>
Don’t stay
</p>
<p>
I don’t need you anymore<br/>
I don’t want to be ignored<br/>
I don’t need one more day<br/>
Of you wasting me away<br/>
I don’t need you anymore<br/>
I don’t want to be ignored<br/>
I don’t need one more day<br/>
Of you wasting me away<br/>
With no apologies
</p>
<p>
Don’t stay<br/>
Forget our memories<br/>
Forget our possibilities<br/>
What you were changing me into<br/>
(Just give me myself back and)<br/>
Don’t stay<br/>
Forget our memories<br/>
Forget our possibilities<br/>
Take all your faithlessness with you<br/>
(Just give me myself back and)<br/>
Don’t stay<br/>
Don't stay<br/>
Don't stay<br/>
